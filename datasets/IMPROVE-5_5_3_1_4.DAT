This is the data file   IMPROVE-5_5_3_1_4.DAT.
Source: This example is used on page pri5314.htm of the e-Handbook
        to demonstrate an optimization design.

Description:  The response variable (Y) is the percentage yield of
              a chemical process.  The two factor variables are
              temperature (in degrees celcius) (X1) and the reaction
              time (in minutes) (X2).

              This is a follow-up experiment to the data in files
              IMPROVE-5_5_3_1_1.DAT and IMPROVE-5_5_3_1_3.DAT.
              It is the second phase of the optimization experiments.
