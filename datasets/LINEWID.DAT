Source: This example is used on page mpc371.htm of the e-Handbook
        to demonstrate control charts for instrument calibration.
        Data is from Carroll Croarkin.

Description:  Line widths of three photomask reference standards (at
              the low, middle and high end of the calibration line) were
              measured on six days with an optical imaging system that
              had been calibrated from similar measurements on 10
              reference artifacts.
