        The data was provided by Carroll Croakin.
Description:  Measurements of resistivity (ohm.cm) for 5 probes and
              5 wafers. 

Data:         Column 1:   Probe ID
              Column 2:   Average of 5 measurement for Wafer 138
              Column 3:   Average of 5 measurement for Wafer 139
              Column 4:   Average of 5 measurement for Wafer 140
              Column 5:   Average of 5 measurement for Wafer 141
              Column 6:   Average of 5 measurement for Wafer 142

              The standard deviations for the 5 wafers are
              0.02643  0.02612  0.02826   0.03038  0.02711.
