Cuenca1 Created: 2021-12-09; Updated: 2021-12-10 10:27:00 About Course Description This course is intended for students enrolled in the BS Statistics program and other allied degree courses. This is a course that focuses on the two major areas of Statistics, namely, descriptive and inferential statistics. Topics on descriptive statistics include the collection, organization and presentation of data. Moreover, basic mathematical concepts on probability, counting techniques and some probability distributions are discussed. Topics on inferential statistics focus on estimation and hypothesis testing. Also, basic statistical modeling techniques like simple linear regression, correlation analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are included in the course. Course Objective By the end of this course, the students are able to grasp the concepts of descriptive and inferential statistics. Moreover, the students will be provided with an overview of the most common statistical methodologies in dealing with the collection, presentation and organization of data. Also, the students will be updated with the knowledge on some data analysis tools in statistical inference like estimation, tests of hypothesis and regression and correlation analyses. In addition, the student will be able to grasp basic mathematical concepts on probability and some probability distributions in preparation for their next mathematical statistics courses.

It is not an exaggeration to say that the rise and fall of a nation is highly related on the quantity and quality (in terms of accuracy and recency2) of information it possess. A historic example for this is the defeat of the Nazis during the World War II when their encrypted top-secret messages, called Enigma codes, had been intercepted by Poland prior to the war. Through the help of Britishs secret code-breaking group known as Ultra under mathematician Alan M. Turing, the codes had been decrypted and had become a valuable source of intelligence during the war. Moreover, since the Enigma codes had been shared by the Nazis to the Japanese, the information gathered by Ultra had contributed to the victory of Allied forces against the Axis in the Pacific. Figure 1.1: (Left) Alan Turing; (Right) Enigma Machine Poland would have never been successful in intercepting the Enigma codes prior to the war if it were not for their good information gathering. Alan Turing and the other Ultra members would not have been successful in cracking the codes if it were not for the right information processing. Lastly, the Allied forces would have not been victorious if it were not for the right information communication as the Ultra group shared the decryption process theyve learned. War commentators have claimed that this information flow, with the Ultra at its core, had substantially shorted the war and could possibly resulted to a different aftermath (Keegan 2003). 1.2 Information vs. Data Proper information is needed to perform various management functions, utilise many management techniques (such as SWOT analysis, PEST analysis), prepare strategic decisions. So it is important to prepare and maintain efficient information system within the organization References "],["methods-of-data-collection.html", "Chapter 2 Methods of Data Collection", " Chapter 2 Methods of Data Collection "],["tabular-and-graphical-presentations-of-data.html", "Chapter 3 Tabular and Graphical Presentations of Data", " Chapter 3 Tabular and Graphical Presentations of Data "],["numerical-description-of-data.html", "Chapter 4 Numerical Description of Data", " Chapter 4 Numerical Description of Data "],["counting-techniques.html", "Chapter 5 Counting Techniques", " Chapter 5 Counting Techniques "],["introduction-to-probability.html", "Chapter 6 Introduction to Probability", " Chapter 6 Introduction to Probability "],["some-probability-distributions.html", "Chapter 7 Some Probability Distributions 7.1 Discrete Distributions 7.2 Continuous Distributions", " Chapter 7 Some Probability Distributions 7.1 Discrete Distributions Binomial Distribution Poisson Distribution 7.2 Continuous Distributions Normal Distribution Normal Approximations to the Binomial Distribution "],["point-and-interval-estimation.html", "Chapter 8 Point and Interval Estimation", " Chapter 8 Point and Interval Estimation "],["tests-concerning-means.html", "Chapter 9 Tests Concerning Means 9.1 One-Sample Mean 9.2 Difference of Two Means: Two Independent Samples 9.3 Difference of Two Means: Paired Observations 9.4 ANOVA", " Chapter 9 Tests Concerning Means 9.1 One-Sample Mean 9.2 Difference of Two Means: Two Independent Samples 9.3 Difference of Two Means: Paired Observations 9.4 ANOVA "],["test-concerning-proportions.html", "Chapter 10 Test Concerning Proportions 10.1 One-Sample Proportions 10.2 Difference of Two Proportions", " Chapter 10 Test Concerning Proportions 10.1 One-Sample Proportions 10.2 Difference of Two Proportions "],["tests-concerning-variances.html", "Chapter 11 Tests Concerning Variances 11.1 Test About Population Variance 11.2 Test of Equality of Two Variances", " Chapter 11 Tests Concerning Variances 11.1 Test About Population Variance 11.2 Test of Equality of Two Variances "],["test-involving-frequency-data.html", "Chapter 12 Test Involving Frequency Data 12.1 Goodness-of-Fit Test", " Chapter 12 Test Involving Frequency Data 12.0.1 Test for Independence 12.1 Goodness-of-Fit Test "],["simple-linear-regression-analysis.html", "Chapter 13 Simple Linear Regression Analysis", " Chapter 13 Simple Linear Regression Analysis "],["correlation-anaysis.html", "Chapter 14 Correlation Anaysis", " Chapter 14 Correlation Anaysis "],["analysis-of-variance-of-linear-regression.html", "Chapter 15 Analysis of Variance of Linear Regression", " Chapter 15 Analysis of Variance of Linear Regression "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
