___Course Description___

This course is intended for students enrolled in the BS Statistics program and other allied degree courses. 
This is a course that focuses on the two major areas of Statistics, namely, descriptive and inferential statistics. 
Topics on descriptive statistics include the collection, organization and presentation of data. 
Moreover, basic mathematical concepts on probability, counting techniques and some probability distributions are discussed. 
Topics on inferential statistics focus on estimation and hypothesis testing. 
Also, basic statistical modeling techniques like simple linear regression, correlation analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are included in the course.

___Course Objective___

By the end of this course, the students are able to grasp the concepts of descriptive and inferential statistics. 
Moreover, the students will be provided with an overview of the most common statistical methodologies in dealing with the collection, presentation and organization of data. 
Also, the students will be updated with the knowledge on some data analysis tools in statistical inference like estimation, tests of hypothesis and regression and correlation analyses. 
In addition, the student will be able to grasp basic mathematical concepts on probability and some probability distributions in preparation for their next mathematical statistics courses.
