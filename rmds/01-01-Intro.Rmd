## The Power of Information

```

No successful organization has ever ignored the power of information. It is not an exaggeration to say that the rise and fall of a nation is highly related on the quantity and quality (in terms of accuracy and recency^[The state or quality of being recent; newness; new state; freshness]) of information it possess. A historic example for this is the defeat of the Nazis during the World War II when their encrypted top-secret messages, called [Enigma codes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Enigma-German-code-device){target="_blank"}, had been intercepted by Poland prior to the war. Through the help of British's secret code-breaking group known as [Ultra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra){target="_blank"} under mathematician [Alan M. Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing){target="_blank"}, the codes had been decrypted and had become a valuable source of intelligence during the war. Moreover, since the Enigma codes had been shared by the Nazis to the Japanese, the information gathered by Ultra had contributed to the victory of [Allied forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II){target="_blank"} against the [Axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers){target="_blank"} in the Pacific.

Poland would have never been successful in intercepting the Enigma codes prior to the war if it were not for their good _information gathering_. Alan Turing and the other Ultra members would not have been successful in cracking the codes if it were not for the right _information processing_. Lastly, the Allied forces would have not been victorious if it were not for the right _information communication_ as the Ultra group shared the decryption process they've learned. War commentators have claimed that this information flow, with the Ultra at it's core, had substantially shorted the war and could possibly resulted to a different aftermath [@keegan2003intelligence].


## Information vs. Data

As pointed out 

Proper information is needed to perform various management functions, utilise many management techniques (such as SWOT analysis, PEST analysis), prepare strategic decisions. So it is important to prepare and maintain efficient information system within the organization




<!-- Efficiency and effectiveness of each decision are highly dependent on both the quality and quantity of information. -->

<!-- The most common definition of information is that it is data which is organized and specified for certain purpose, is accurate and timely, in a context which gives it value and importance and can possibly lead to widening of understanding on a subject or decrease uncertainty. Importance of information lies within a fact that it can affect decision making, behaviour or an outcome of certain event. For example, on a stock exchange if there is an information of company reporting significant decrease in profits the price of shares is falling not because of decrease itself but because of the information of it which causes share owners to sell their shares causing the decrease in price. -->

<!-- ## The importance of data in decision-making -->

<!-- The ability to make effective decisions is crucial to an organization's survival in today's tumultuous business environment. In order for -->
<!-- firms to evaluate alternatives and make informed choices they must have -->
<!-- reliable and timely data upon which to make their decisions. Consequently, -->
<!-- the development of effective data management techniques is of central importance to an organization. Yet, many firms are learning that this is no -->
<!-- easy task as they find themselves inundated with nearly overwhelming -->
<!-- amounts of data. Assessing the specific data management issues firms face -->
<!-- and the development of an effective methodology to address these issues is -->
<!-- a central focus of this chapter. Specifically, this chapter explores data -->
<!-- management from a cybernetic approach and focuses on methods of transforming various forms of structured and semi-structured data into structured, useful data that an organization can utilize to make effective, informed decisions. -->


<!-- ## Impact of information on decision-making  -->

<!-- The quantity and quality of the information affects the efficiency and rationality of decisions. Choosing appropriate criteria for the selection of options (making a decision) is one of the fundamental problems of decision theory. One of the first selection criteria was established by the mainstream quantitative approach (operations research) and is on the search for the optimal solution, best under given circumstances. -->

<!-- The decision making process can be described as a process of transformation of information. Therefore, when considering the decision managers must take into account the issues of information processes, or more broadly, information and analysis of decision-making. This approach leads to following interpretation of the decision: -->

<!--   - Information is a kind of material for decision -->
<!--   - Any decision is also information for subsequent decisions -->
<!--   - The decision is information that causes action taken by subordinates or decisions of other managers. -->

<!-- Most of the information needed for managers is used to plan and control operations and to realization of their responsibility. Depending on the level in the hierarchy nature of the information needed by managers differs. Top management takes strategic decisions on major long-term perspective, and also formulate general objectives of the organization. At this level most useful information is obtained from the environment, and partly from inside information. Middle management makes tactical decisions and implements the policy set by the chief executives. They need internal and external information for both control and planning. Lower-level management (operational) mainly deals with current affairs, and therefore requires detailed inside information. Because the decision-making is a process of information processing, managers can be regarded as entities selecting and processing the information to make a decision.  -->
